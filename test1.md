Here is a code snippet for creating a custom dataset:

```python
import csv

def create_dataset(filename):
  """Creates a dataset from a CSV file.

  Args:
    filename: The path to the CSV file.

  Returns:
    A list of lists, where each inner list is a row in the dataset.
  """
  with open(filename, "r") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=",")
    return [row for row in reader]

def main():
  """Creates a custom dataset from a CSV file."""
  filename = "data.csv"
  dataset = create_dataset(filename)
  print(dataset)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

This code snippet will create a dataset from a CSV file called `data.csv`. The dataset will be a list of lists, where each inner list is a row in the CSV file. The code snippet will then print the dataset to the console.
