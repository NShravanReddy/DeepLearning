Hey go throught my commands one by one

First In DeepLearning folder got to this path docs/_posts and create a readme file with todays date and the day should be the number after the last modified file in the current folder

After creating the readme file in the _posts directory then go to the docs/index.md then add the 
like this the file which we created with todays date and day.
Example if the 
today is 17-03-2025  and prevoius readme file is 2025-03-16-triton-day9.md then readme file name should be like 2025-03-16-triton-day10.md file we created readme file like
- [Day 10 - Learning Triton](./_posts/2025-03-17-triton-day10.md)
